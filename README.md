### Adding a workflow

Create a JSON file containing the workflow steps:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Step 1",
    "command": "echo 'Step 1'",
    "description": "First step of the workflow",
    "continue_on_error": false
  },
  {
    "name": "Step 2",
    "command": "echo 'Step 2'",
    "description": "Second step of the workflow",
    "continue_on_error": true
  }
]
```

Then add the workflow:

```bash
clix add-workflow my-workflow --description "My workflow" --steps-file workflow.json
```

### Running a workflow

```bash
clix run-workflow my-workflow
```

### Exporting commands and workflows
